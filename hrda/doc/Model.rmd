```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## 1. 모형

전처리 완료한 인사데이터를 활용해 모형을 만들고 이를 머신 러닝으로 구축할 준비를 한다.

## R Source Code

You can include R code in the document as follows:

```{r data}
str(data)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=TRUE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
